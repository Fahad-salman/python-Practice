#1 First thing will import the data from our csv file or database.
#2 Second thing will clean the data - to have perfect data of the columns and rows , to get the good result.
#3 We will split the data , training set and test set .
#4 Createing a Model, there is a package or library called sklearn and NumPy and Pandas.
#5 Check the output.
#6 Improv

# - NumPy -> to help us to use list and arrays in python in spesificly multidimensional arrays . 
# - Pandas -> to use data anlysis , to give us an idea of this data frame allow functionality to manipulate data . for csv file or tabular data.
# - Scikit-learn -> to help us to use machine learning algorithms.
# - matplotlib -> charting data 

# jupyter notebook it's important for machine learning, to step through the data to understand the data

#  last thing we need data to work with , thers is a tool called kaggle , there is free data to work with.
